The first step I did was set up my beagle bone by referring
To the instructions on piazza.

I connected it to my computer,
Double clicked on START.htm file and follow the instructions
To download the appropriate driver.

Afterwards I ran the following command

sudo ssh root@192.168.7.2

And first entered my computer's password,
Then I logged into my beagle bone

After successfully SSH into my beagle bone,
I  call

sudo connmanctl

Enable wifi

Scan wifi

Services

Agent on

Then I just connect to the UCLA_WEB wifi
And quit the process.

Afterwards, I updated the databases and installed xauth & xvfb

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install xauth
sudo apt-get install xvfb

Then I also make sure the environment is set up properly
by checking if openssh is there by calling 

dpkg --get-selections | grep openssh

Then I make sure X11 forwarding is enabled
And also make sure forwardAgent has yes.
/etc/ssh/ssh_config
/etc/ssh/sshd_config 
~/.ssh/config 

Afterwards I downloaded the X11 client on my computer and 
Firefox on beagle bone

sudo apt-get install firefox-esr-l10n-en-gb

-------------
For the Laboratory, my partner was Sriram Sonti and I acted as the Server.

I set up the public and private keys first by calling

ssh-keygen


Then I create an account for the client on the server

sudo useradd –d /home/erica –m Eric
 
sudo passwd 1234

Then I create the .ssh directory

cd /home/erica
sudo mkdir .ssh

Then I update the permissions 

 sudo chown –R Eric .ssh

 sudo chmod 700 .ssh

After this step, I provided my partner Sriram
With my username and server IP address by calling
Ifconfig and checking the IP address under wlan0.

After I provide this, Sriram executes the steps for
The Client and he's successfully able to ssh into my beaglebone
And ran firefox on it.
