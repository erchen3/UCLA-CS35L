1)
I want to first grab the Coreutils 8.29 source code compressed tarball
So I perform wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-8.29.tar.xz

Then I do the same for the signature and GNU keyring
wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-8.29.tar.xz.sig
wget https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-keyring.gpg

Then I run the shell command provided
gpg --verify --keyring ./gnu-keyring.gpg coreutils-8.29.tar.xz.sig
No problems encountered during verification.

2)
I first used command tar –xzvf coreutils-8.29.tar.xz, didn't get the files.
I used man tar, and changed the command to tar –xJvf coreutils-8.29.tar.xz
Then I made a directory called coreutilsInstall - mkdir coreutilsInstall
Go to the coreutils-8.29 file cd coreutils-8.29
Use the following command to ensure autoreconf is installed autoreconf -f -i
Use Configure and the make and make install to install files to directory
./configure --prefix =/u/cs/ugrad/jeung/lab3/coreutilsInstall
make
make install
There are now directories in coreutilsInstall

3) I now want to reproduce the bug on my machine. I go to the directory
cd coreutilsInstall/bin and produce the bug calling the command ls -a -A

4) Now I want to apply the patch.
Go to directory, cd coreutilsInstall then I create a file called patch_file.
I paste the patch content from Bug#30963 Message #10 there.
emacs patch_file.
I first tried patch -p0 < patch_file and I noticed it did not work. So I tried
patch -p1 < patch_file and it worked, so it must've removed the first sequence.

5) Now I'm going to build the fixed version.
I call the command make.
There are fewer files displayed on this round of calling the command.

6)I check the unmatched version by calling ls command.
  cd coreutilsInstall/bin
  ./ls -a -A
  Then I go to the patched directory and call the same command.
  cd coreutils-8.29/src
  ./ls -a -A
. and .. are dont exist in the patched directory, but does in coreutilsInstall.
