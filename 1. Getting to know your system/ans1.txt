For question 1 the command is  man -k <keyword to search>

For question 2,  using which mv, we find it is located in /usr/bin/mv
                 using which sh, we find it is at /usr/bin/sh

For question 3, The command used was find /usr/local/cs/bin -executable -name '?r'
                I used man find to help me figure out what to search in
                addition  to the slides

                /usr/local/cs/bin/pr
                It is a shell command that paginates files for printing

                /usr/local/cs/bin/tr
                Shell command that can translate or rdelete characters.

For question 4,  the actual file that will be executed is /usr/bin/emacs-24.3
                 The keystrokes I used were :
                   /usr/bin/emacs
                   cd /usr/bin
                   ls -l emacs
                   cd /etc/alternatives
                   ls -l emacs
                 /usr/bin/emacs is ultimately a symbolic link to /usr/bin/emacs-24.3

For question 5, the version of /usr/bin/gcc  is gcc (GCC) 4.8.5 20150623 (Red Hat 4.8.5-36)
                using the command /usr/bin/gcc --version
                the version of plain gcc is gcc (GCC) 8.2.0
                using command gcc --version
                They are different programs because the plain gcc version is a soft link to a different version.  gcc -> ../gcc-8.2.0/bin/gcc
                While the version in /usr/bin/gcc is a hard link to another version

For question 6, the symbolic mode u+sx, o-w means that we set a user ID on execution and give user execute permissions. In addition, for others we remove
                write permission.

For question 7, The commands I used were first, man find and then find /usr/local/cs -type d -mtime -28

For Question 9, the oldest regular file in /usr/lib64 directory is librom1394.so.0.3.0,
                it was found using the commands:  cd /usr/lib64
                                                  ls -lt
                The date of that file was Dec 28  2013.]

For Question 10, the locale command gets its data from the settings of the environment variables that control the  locale. I used
                 man locale to find this.

For Question 11, the commands that have downcase in their name are downcase-region and downcase-word
                  I used  C-h a downcase to find this.

For Question 12, C-M-r runs the command isearch-backward-regexp.
                 C-M-s runs the command isearch-forward-regexp.
                 C-M-t runs the command transpose-sexps
                 C-M-u runs the command backward-up-list
                 C-M-v runs the command scroll-other-window.
                 I used C-h k and entered C-M-r ....  C-M-v to search in help about what it does.
For Question 13,C-g runs the command keyboard-quit. It can help you get out of a pickle.
                I used C-h k and enter C-g to figure it out but also read it.

For Question 14, Yanking means reinserting text previously killed.  I used the GNU Emacs manual as reference.

For Question 15,  when looking at /usr/bin with ls -l we can see many files listed with their timestamps.
                  Using the dired comand, a difference that  I noticed was that there were more files displayed suggesting hidden files appeared.
                  Also, the ls -l lists files only, but the Dired commands have the ability to operate on listed file.
